# BSDL
BSDL (Beat Saber Downloader) is a program designed to mass download beat saber maps based on the user that created the Map
This is done by using the BeatSaver.com REST API, allowing the program to check the most updated index of maps.
User interaction is done using the tkinter python framework.
