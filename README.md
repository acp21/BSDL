# BSDL
BSDL (Beat Saber Downloader) is a program designed to mass download beat saber maps.

Upon launch, the program opens a gui with a single text box, the user inputs the username of a mapper on beatsaver.com, and the program will download all maps 
by that user
.
The program works using several libraries, including tkinter, selenium webdriver, bs4, and requests.
